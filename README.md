# P2Phoenix

To start your phoenix project just install docker in your machine and run

	* docker-compose up --build

Then you can open localhost:4000 in your elixir development

I leave a simple user model, view and controller for user registration (without login at this stage) just to give an example.

If you were having problems with compose up just download the zip file and run the same command.
